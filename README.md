# FocusBlockâ„¢ - Time management application
I did not find a good and simple time-blocking app in the Google Play Store or elsewhere, so I decided to make my own, which is minimalistic and simple enough. I personally don't like that mobile applications become distractions instead of tools to improve productivity, and this is the problem I try to fix with this project.

The goal is to make first base features and maintainable code structure, then optimize the application as a comprehensive cross-platform application with firebase/supabase backend with real-time data synchronizing. The full version of the application with cloud synchronizing and cross-platform features could be then monetized based on a monthly SaaS subscription.

# Feature list

 - Adding blocks with name, block start and end time
 - Adding notes, todo lists, links and (soon) notification for each block
 - Saving and loading blocks as To Do blocks
 - Saving and loading templates

# Technical specification / tech stack

 - Dart
 - Flutter
 - Shared preferences library for saving the data locally in JSON
